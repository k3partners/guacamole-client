/**
 * A service for authenticating a user against the REST API. Invoking the
 * authenticate() or login() functions of this service will automatically
 * affect the login dialog, if visible.
 *
 * This service broadcasts events on $rootScope depending on the status and
 * result of authentication operations:
 *
 *  "guacLoginPending"
 *      An authentication request is being submitted and we are awaiting the
 *      result. The request may not yet have been submitted if the parameters
 *      for that request are not ready. This event receives a promise that
 *      resolves with the HTTP parameters that were ultimately submitted as its
 *      sole parameter.
 *
 *  "guacLogin"
 *      Authentication was successful and a new token was created. This event
 *      receives the authentication token as its sole parameter.
 *
 *  "guacLogout"
 *      An existing token is being destroyed. This event receives the
 *      authentication token as its sole parameter. If the existing token for
 *      the current session is being replaced without destroying that session,
 *      this event is not fired.
 *
 *  "guacLoginFailed"
 *      An authentication request has failed for any reason. This event is
 *      broadcast before any other events that are specific to the nature of
 *      the failure, and may be used to detect login failures in lieu of those
 *      events. This event receives two parameters: the HTTP parameters
 *      submitted and the Error object received from the REST endpoint.
 *
 *  "guacInsufficientCredentials"
 *      An authentication request failed because additional credentials are
 *      needed before the request can be processed. This event receives two
 *      parameters: the HTTP parameters submitted and the Error object received
 *      from the REST endpoint.
 *
 *  "guacInvalidCredentials"
 *      An authentication request failed because the credentials provided are
 *      invalid. This event receives two parameters: the HTTP parameters
 *      submitted and the Error object received from the REST endpoint.
